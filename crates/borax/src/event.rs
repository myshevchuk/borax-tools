//! What a run says about itself.
//!
//! A run produces one stream of events, and the two output modes are
//! two renderings of it: `--json` writes each event as a JSON object on
//! its own line, and the default mode writes the same events as prose.
//! Neither mode learns anything the other does not, so a script and a
//! person are told the same story.
//!
//! Diagnostics are deliberately not events. Progress, warnings, and
//! failures that are about the run rather than about a file go to
//! stderr as [`Diagnostic`]s, which is what keeps stdout parseable line
//! by line.
